Link for my App- https://spamemailclassification-bysuman.streamlit.app/
Problem Statement: Develop a machine learning model to classify emails as spam or non-spam based
on their content and metadata.

Tasks:

Task 1:

Introduction to spam email classification and its impact on email filtering.

Overview of classification algorithms suitable for this task.

Task 2:

Data set preparation: Collect a dataset containing email samples and corresponding labels.

Perform text data preprocessing, such as removing stop words, stemming, or vectorization.

Task 3:

Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset and identify important
features.

Perform feature extraction or selection, such as using TF-IDF or word embeddings.

Task 4:

Implement a baseline classification model, such as Naive Bayes or a support vector machine (SVM)
classifier.

Explain evaluation metrics for spam email classification, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

Task 5:

Improve the model's performance through techniques like feature engineering or ensemble models.

Discuss strategies for handling class imbalance, if present, such as adjusting classification thresholds.

Task 6:

Evaluate the model's performance on a test set and discuss the results.

Identify limitations and suggest potential enhancements.

Prepare a presentation summarizing the findings and provide feedback.

Evaluation criteria: 

Model accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and presentation quality.

Dataset Format:

Collect a dataset with email samples and corresponding labels (spam or non-spam).

The dataset should include email content and metadata such as sender, subject, and timestamp.

Data Types:

Text columns for email content, categorical column for labels (spam or non-spam), and string columns for sender, subject, and timestamp.
